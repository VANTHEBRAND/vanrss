Welcome to vanfeed, a lightweight content management system (CMS) self-hosted on Cloudflare and based on microfeed.
With vanfeed, van can easily publish a variety of content such as audios, videos, photos, documents, blog posts,
and external URLs to a feed in the form of web, RSS, and JSON. It's the perfect solution for tech-savvy individuals who
want to self-host their own CMS without having to run their own servers.

vanfeed is built by VAN BRAND based on microfeed which is built by [Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/) and is hosted on Cloudflare's [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/),
[R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/), [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/), and [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/).

## How it works

Since the 1990s, a significant portion of the web has been powered by feeds.
People (and bots) publish items to a feed, and others can subscribe to that feed to receive new content.

vanfeed makes it easy for individuals to self-host their own feed on Cloudflare, including but not limited to
* a podcast feed of audios
* a blog feed of posts
* an Instagram-like feed of images (e.g., [llamacorn.listennotes.com](https://llamacorn.listennotes.com/))
* a YouTube-like feed of videos
* a personal website with custom links (e.g., [wenbin.org](https://www.wenbin.org/))
* a content curation feed of external urls
* a marketing site with updates and press coverage (e.g., [microfeed.org](https://www.microfeed.org/))
* ...

vanfeed uses Cloudflare [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to host and run the code,
[R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) to host and serve media files,
[D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) to store metadata,
and [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) to provide logins to the admin dashboard.
Cloudflare provides very generous free usage quotas, making it an affordable solution for personal or small business use.
While you will still need to pay for a domain name, hosting microfeed on Cloudflare is essentially free.

With vanfeed, you can publish a variety of content such as audios, videos, photos, documents, blog posts,
and external URLs to a customizable website, an RSS feed, and a [JSON feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org/).
Check out some examples of microfeed (which vanfeed is based on) in action:
* Web feed: [https://llamacorn.listennotes.com/](https://llamacorn.listennotes.com/)
* Rss feed: [https://llamacorn.listennotes.com/rss/](https://llamacorn.listennotes.com/rss/)
* Json feed: [https://llamacorn.listennotes.com/json/](https://llamacorn.listennotes.com/json/)

vanfeed provides a simple yet powerful admin dashboard that makes it easy to add items to the feed,
upload media files, and customize web page styles. If you've used WordPress before, you'll find it familiar.

## Installation

Roughly you'll follow these steps to install a vanfeed instance to Cloudflare:

1. Fork the [microfeed repo](https://github.com/microfeed/microfeed) to your personal (or organizational) GitHub account.
2. Obtain Cloudflare API tokens and save them as secrets on your forked GitHub repository.
3. Use the predefined GitHub Action in your forked repository to deploy the code to Cloudflare Pages, using the secrets from step 2.
4. Make a few clicks on Cloudflare's dashboard to set up custom domains and configure some security settings.
5. Done. Start publishing!

> We understand that not everyone is comfortable with reading documentation, so we've made it as easy as possible
> to get started with microfeed. However, we'd love to see Cloudflare implement a "Login with Cloudflare" OAuth feature,
> which would allow for almost one-click deployment of microfeed. In the meantime, we've tried to make the setup process
> as straightforward as possible for tech-savvy users.


### Prerequisites

* Have a Cloudflare account. If you don't have one already, you can [sign up for free at Cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
* Have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for free at GitHub.com](https://github.com/signup).

### Step 1. Fork the vanfeed repo to your GitHub

Simply click on [https://github.com/VANTHEBRAND/vanrss/fork](https://github.com/VANTHEBRAND/vanrss) to fork the repository.

You may choose to modify the code in your forked repository in the future, van has customized it for himself so
you probably will have to. Simply fork the repository and keep it synced for future use.

### Step 2. Put some secrets on your forked repo

Go to your forked repo's [Settings -> Secrets -> Actions](../../settings/secrets/actions), and create 5 secrets (click for more details).
With these secrets in place, you'll be able to use GitHub Actions to deploy your vanfeed instance to Cloudflare Pages.

<details>
  <summary><b>CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID</b></summary>

You can get your cloudflare account id from your dashboard's url:

After you [login your Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login?lang=en-US), you'll be redirected to a url like this
```
https://dash.cloudflare.com/[your-cloudflare-account-id-here]
```
The last part of the url is your cloudflare account id.

For example, if you see a url like this:
```
https://dash.cloudflare.com/fff88980eeeeedcc3ffffd4f555f4999
```

Then you'll set **CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID** to **fff88980eeeeedcc3ffffd4f555f4999**:

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN</b></summary>

You'll need to create an API token here: [https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)

Create a custom token:

<img width="925" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 30 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205525627-14da54ae-1733-4db5-b65d-94f5ec48f360.png">

We need edit permission for both Cloudflare Pages and D1:

<img width="990" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 31 41 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205525675-4c8a6bce-21a8-45e3-bf0c-28981f123da3.png">

Finally, copy the API token here:

<img width="682" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 34 01 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205525785-6fed8e49-7342-4b36-9d07-348e1c28cbcc.png">


  </details>

<details>
  <summary><b>R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b> and <b>R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</b></summary>

Go to your [R2 dashboard page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/r2). You may need to put your credit card there first. You won't need to pay, unless your usage exceeds the very generous free quota limit (i.e., 10GB storage + 10 million reads/month + 1 million writes/month).

Create an R2 API token here:

  <img width="1328" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 43 58 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205526381-cc11d4fe-b053-49d0-9072-de54db31b3b7.png">

Select "Edit" permission and create an API token:

  <img width="849" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 45 18 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205526491-79a87e1e-02e0-4268-9f88-7d9cdc6b3b68.png">

Copy Access Key ID for R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and Secret Access Key for R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  <img width="728" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 45 35 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205526582-92f440ac-21c4-46d9-a065-cfc1937391c8.png">


</details>


<details>
  <summary><b>CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME</b></summary>

A legit project name should have these characters: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], and -

We recommend using the custom domain name that you'll use for this project and replace dot (.) with dash (-)

For example, if you use photos.mycustomdomain.com, then the project name should be photos-mycustomdomain-com

Note: Don't use underscore (_), space ( ), and other characters outside [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9] and -. Or Cloudflare Pages won't let you create a project.
</details>

In total, you'll add 5 secrets for GitHub Actions:

<img width="826" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 10 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205524410-268abf92-af61-467a-8883-78b8d4de3c56.png">


### Step 3. Run GitHub Action to deploy code

Go to [Actions -> Deploy to Cloudflare Pages](../../actions/workflows/deploy.yml) and run Workflow

<img width="1606" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 11 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205526856-05ea0ff4-703a-4d08-bc7f-4ae2dfc07cfe.png">

If you see the green checkmark, then the deployment is successful. And you can see a Pages project in your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/pages):


<img width="880" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 4 55 10 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/205527141-277620dd-586b-42dd-be97-edb7875d0705.png">

You can access the site via ${CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME}.pages.dev, for example, [https://microfeed-org.pages.dev/](https://microfeed-org.pages.dev/)

### Step 4. Make a few clicks on Cloudflare dashboard

To manage your microfeed instance, you'll use the admin dashboard at ${CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME}.pages.dev/admin, for example, [https://microfeed-org.pages.dev/admin/](https://microfeed-org.pages.dev/admin/) (the admin dashboard needs to be protected by Cloudflare Zero Trust).

Upon accessing the admin dashboard for the first time, you'll complete the setup process by following the checklist:

<img width="1182" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-17 at 10 34 05 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/208216864-38a65086-77ef-4595-bc05-c87be2676e6d.png">

### Step 5. Done. Start publishing!

Once you've completed the setup process, your vanfeed instance will be ready to use.
You can add, update, or delete items from the admin dashboard.

You can also customize the appearance of the website at Settings / Custom code by editing the raw HTML and CSS:

<img width="1094" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-26 at 1 15 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/209499220-a2f7b7e4-f0b0-422a-bdf2-2ffed4b37aff.png">


### Bonus. Update to the latest version of vanfeed

vanfeed will continue to add new features and fix bugs and add fetures and bug fixes from the microfeed repo.
You may want to update your forked repo with the new code.

You'll first sync up the code in your forked repo:

<img width="488" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-26 at 7 58 32 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/209483973-c82e7808-0d21-4aad-ac2d-c4e80da691bc.png">

Then go to [Actions -> Deploy to Cloudflare Pages](../../actions/workflows/deploy.yml) and run Workflow to deploy the new code.



## FAQs

<details>
<summary><b>How can I track podcast / video / image downloads?</b></summary>

To track podcast, video, or image downloads with microfeed, you can use the tracking URLs feature.
This allows you to set up third-party tracking URLs for your media files, such as those provided by Podtrac or Chartable.

To set up tracking URLs, you will need to go to Settings / Tracking URLs:
<img width="1101" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-17 at 10 19 50 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719237/208216098-1c8ab8df-eeae-4e50-96c8-4347911ee281.png">

From there, you can add the third-party tracking URLs that you want to use.
microfeed will automatically add these URLs to the front of the URL for your media files, allowing you to track download statistics.

This is a [common practice in the podcast industry](https://lowerstreet.co/blog/podcast-tracking) and can be a useful way to monitor the performance of your content and understand how it is being consumed by your audience.
